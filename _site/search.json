    "text": "Land Use of Singapore\nOur project focused on the viability of installing solar farms within Singapore to boost its energy output. To that end, our first primary objective was to find large areas of land that would allow for installations of as many solar panels as feasibly possible.\nThe first step involved isolating the amount of gazetted usable land space within Singapore. To do so, we utilised the dataset from Master Plan 2019. Areas labelled as ‘Open Space’ were denoted to be potential land areas that we could make use of, as it meant that there were no immediate plans to construct other types of infrastructure. We also gave priority to Open Spaces that covered large surface areas, as that would be more efficient as compared to numerous small Open Space areas. Areas labelled as ‘Waterbody’ were also denoted as potential areas to utilise. Since Singapore already has an existing floating solar farm at Tengeh Reservoir, there is thus a precedent for using water bodies for solar farms. Additionally, we obtained data on nature reserves within Singapore. These areas are considered unsuitable for solar farms and thus should be avoided. We imposed all these layers onto a map of Singapore, allowing us to identify which areas we should consider looking at in greater depth.\n\n\nNatural Reserve Buffer\nSince we wish to avoid placing solar farms within close proximity of nature reserves, we used the buffer tool to create a 1km radius dissolved buffer zone around the centroid of each natural reserve.\n\n\n\nFig 1.1, Natural Reserve Buffer\n\n\nWe will then clip the land use layer using this buffer to obtain the true suitable area.\n\n\nGetting Temperature Data\nMODIS is a satellite-based sensor aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, capturing Earth’s surface conditions daily since 2000. It provides high-quality measurements across multiple bands, including thermal infrared, essential for analyzing Land Surface Temperature (LST).\n\n\n\nFig 1.2, NASA LST temperature data acquisition\n\n\nAppEEARS is an online platform provided by NASA designed to simplify extraction and analysis of Earth observation datasets. It offers easy access to MODIS data and provides GIS-ready files in GeoTIFF format. We decided to use NASA APPEEARS data for our surface temperature data sources. The request was crafted to download data in GeoTiff format for better processing in QGIS. We decided to download the data for Terra MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emmisivity, which uses thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32, which are the most crucial for the algorithms that determine both land surface temperature and emissivity.\n\n\n\nFig 1.3, NASA LST temperature data results graph\n\n\nFrom this data, we attained firsthand accurate temperature data across Singapore. However, this represents Land Surface Temperature, which is not relevant for our considerations on Solar farms, since the range between all data points being presented in are within 20 Kelvins of each other, comfortably within the operating temperature window for Solar Panels.\n\n\nGetting Solar Irradiation Data\nMore crucial for our investigation is the Solar Irradiation Data figures for Singapore, since it will allow us to get an accurate estimate of the potential power output provided by any potential photovoltaic solar farm within the Singapore area. The widely cited figure for Singapore is 1580Kwh/m^2, but we decided to gather more comprehensively detailed firsthand data for our investigation.\nWe eventually settled on using the NASA Power project. The NASA Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) Project provides data in improving the accessibility and usage of NASA Earth Observations (EO) data, supporting community research and applications in renewable energy, sustainable buildings, and agroclimatology.\nDirect access to GIS data from NASA’s power project proved too difficult to obtain, since it was locked behind ArcGIS access, so we eventually settled on gathering data manually by scraping their API function\nWe settled on the ALLSKY_SFC_SW (All Sky Surface Shortwave Downward Irradiance) parameter for our API request since it corresponded to the irradiation data we needed for our investigation. The parameters for latitude and longitude were carefully chosen to be within Singapore’s land boundaries.\n\n\n\nFig 1.4, POWER Project API call result JSON result\n\n\nThis was the end result of one of our API scraping. The actual satellite data being used here is from the CERES instrument, which is a broadband radiometer instrument, which means that there is no specific satellite band being used for this data.\nOne disadvantage of using this data source is the SYN1 deg aspect of the CERES instrument. While the data itself is firsthand and accurate for the location, it has a 1 degree latitude/longitude resolution, which means that every point within the same 1-1 lat/long bound would have the same figures for solar irradiation. Due to the small size of Singapore island, this data source would interpret all points of Singapore to have the same irradiation figures. To verify this, our team ran the script 50 more times across different points in Singapore, and created a helper script to compile all CERES data collected into one main csv file.\nThe chosen resolution for CERES supports our inference that apart from elevation, Singapore lacks the geographical variance to have any intrinsic geographical bias when choosing a location for a solar farm.\n\n\n\nFig 1.5, NASA LST temperature data results collation\n\n\nOur helper script ran extra calculations, processing the raw data from fig 1.3, which only gave the average daily radiation across different months and years. For a more broad analysis, our script multiplies the figures to obtain an annual value for all years, and compiles the data across all API scrape operations.\nThe results shown in 1.4 confirm the assertion on the 1 degree resolution, as it can be seen that all geographical points show the same figures across all 3 years of data. But this confirms for us that the annual irradiation across Singapore in recent years is 1668Kwh/M^2, which is higher than the figure provided online, and this will be the figure used in later calculations for our evaluation.\n\n\nAspect and Slope Maps\nOnce we identified the main areas we wanted to perform in-depth analyses on, we then created aspect and slope maps to determine how much construction would be needed to make these areas usable for placing solar farms. Both maps utilised Singapore’s DEM raster data, then using the slope and aspect tools in QGIS.\nWe used data from USGS Earth Explorer, which was open source and allowed us to find detailed topographical data on the Singapore region\n\n\n\nFig 1.6, Singapore Topography data acquisition\n\n\nTo specify the Singapore region, we selected a polygon to isolate the Singapore region and searched for DEM raster maps for elevation pertaining to our selected region, which gave us two different raster maps. As the data was in two separate DEM raster files, we had to manually merge the two in QGIS to get a whole raster map for topography containing all of Singapore, which we used as the base to process out the rest of our aspect and slope data.\n\n\nInfrastructure Proximity\nWe created a proximity map using the OSM dataset on roads in Singapore, then superimposed it over our map along with OSM vector data for buildings in Singapore. Since the construction of solar farms is not relegated to purely the solar panels (fences, storage, drainage swales, etc.), we decided that demarcating areas for these forms of infrastructure to be built was also important. In addition, proximity to roads is vital for ensuring that construction goes smoothly, such that materials can be ferried to the site without excessive effort."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThrough our comprehensive geospatial and feasibility analysis, we have identified Lim Chu Kang and Poyan Reservoir as the most viable zones for solar farm deployment in Singapore. These areas stand out due to their combination of large contiguous land or water surface area, minimal terrain constraints, and strategic alignment with existing infrastructure and national sustainability objectives.\nOur slope and aspect evaluation confirms that Lim Chu Kang’s flat terrain requires minimal land modification, while its existing road and building networks can support auxiliary solar farm operations. Additionally, the area’s potential for agrivoltaics—combining agriculture with solar energy generation—offers a dual-use approach that enhances land efficiency without compromising food production. Poyan Reservoir, on the other hand, benefits from the successful precedent set by Tengeh Reservoir and exhibits shoreline characteristics suitable for essential infrastructure. Its accessibility and existing road connectivity make it a promising site for floating solar farm deployment.\nWhile Murai Subzone presents some potential, its fragmented land pattern and lower return on investment make it less favorable compared to the two aforementioned sites.\nBy combining GIS-based land analysis, solar irradiation data, and realistic deployment factors, our study highlights the scalability, practicality, and long-term benefit of focusing future solar farm efforts on these two key locations. This approach not only supports Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 and energy security strategy, but also underscores the value of integrated, land-sensitive development in a space-constrained nation."

    "text": "Elevation Map\nAs we only care for the raster data of Singapore, we will be clipping out the raster data of the other countries. We will use the CostalOutline shapefile layer for this.\nFirstly, go to Processing &gt; Toolbox to open the Processing Toolbox, then type ‘fix geometries’ into the search bar. Click the Fix geometries tool, under Vector geometry.\n\n\n\nFig 1.1\n\n\nSelect the input layer as CostalOutline, and repair method as ‘Structure’. Run the program when ready.\n\n\n\nFig 1.2\n\n\nWe will now use this output layer ‘Fixed Geometries’ for our raster clipping.\nGo to Raster &gt; Extraction &gt; Clip Raster by Mask Layer. Use the following inputs:\n\n\n\nFig 1.3\n\n\nClick the wrench and select the following:\n\n\n\nFig 1.4\n\n\nWhen ready, run the program. The result should look like this:\n\n\n\nFig 1.5\n\n\nYou may now export this layer as a GEOTIFF file. We shall call it SG_Elevation.\n\n\nSlope\nTo determine the slope data, we will follow the method taught to us: Raster &gt; Analysis &gt; Slope, and inputting SG_Elevation as the input layer:\n\n\n\nFig 1.6\n\n\nNext, we shall reclassify the slope data. Go to Processing &gt; Toolbox and search ‘Reclassify by Table’. Input the following rows:\n\n\n\nFig 1.7\n\n\nRun when ready, the result should be like this:\n\n\n\nFig 1.8\n\n\nSave this as a GEOTIFF, we shall call it Slope_Degree.\n\n\nAspect\nAspect data, put simply, is data that describes the orientation that a slope landform takes. We will obtain this via the following method: go to Raster &gt; Analysis &gt; Aspect, then use the SG_Elevation layer as the input layer:\n\n\n\nFig 1.9\n\n\nClick ‘Run’ when ready, and your result should look like so:\n\n\n\nFig 1.10\n\n\nSave this as a GEOTIFF, we shall call it Aspect. Now, double click the layer and go to the ‘Symbology’ tab. Input the following:\n\n\n\nFig 1.11\n\n\nThe value determines the direction the slope faces: 0 and 360 degrees is North, 90 is East, 180 is South, and 270 is West. After labelling, the result should appear like so:\n\n\n\nFig 1.12\n\n\n\n\nProximity Map to Roads\nOne we have obtained a potential site for our solar farms, we want to see how connected the area is to road infrastructure. Below is a vector layer containing our potential site land space, superimposed with vector data from OSM for roads in Singapore:\n\n\n\nFig 1.13\n\n\nWe will be constructing a proximity map for these roads. First, we Open Attribute Table for our osm roads data and add this field in the field calculator:\n\n\n\nFig 1.14\n\n\nThen, go to Raster &gt; Conversion &gt; Rasterize and input the following:\n\n\n\nFig 1.15\n\n\nOutput extent shall be the base layer. The result is like so:\n\n\n\nFig 1.16\n\n\nNext, go to Processing Toolbox panel, navigate to GDAL Analysis &gt; Proximity (raster distance).\n\n\n\nFig 1.17\n\n\nYour result will be like this:\n\n\n\nFig 1.18\n\n\n\n\nReclassifying\nWe will now reclassify our proximity map so that we can determine suitable areas for constructing various types of infrastructure within solar farms. From the menu bar, click on Processing &gt; Toolbox, and search for Reclassify by Table. The input layer shall be the proximity map we just made. Input the following:\n\n\n\nFig 1.19\n\n\nThe result will be like this:\n\n\n\nFig 1.20\n\n\nSince this is quite vague, we shall edit the Symbology of the layer like so:\n\n\n\nFig 1.21\n\n\nWe will also lower the opacity of the layer so that we can see the base vector layer. The result is this:\n\n\n\nFig 1.22\n\n\n\n\nObtaining Target Areas\nSince we only consider specific regions like Lim Chu Kang and Murai, we need to preprocess the map data such that the focus is shifted to these regions. This is so that analysis is simpler, and the data we handle becomes more lightweight.\nFrom Data Preparation -&gt; Natural Reserve Buffer, the relevant restricted regions have already been filtered out. We will use that layer as a stepping stone to obtain the true regions that we analyze.\nThe only other polygon layer that we need is the Master Plan 2019 Subzone Layer.\n\nOpen the attribute table of the MP19 Subzone Layer.\nOpen “Select Features by Expression”.\nEnter this line:\n“SUBZONE_N” in (‘LIM CHU KANG’, ‘MURAI’) and click “Select Features”.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.2\n\n\nSave this layer as a temporary layer in GeoPackage format.\nGiven we have another layer that accounted for the restricted buffer zones, we want to overlay the temporary Lim Chu Kang + Murai layer to obtain the workable regions for solar farm deployment.\n\nNavigate to Vector -&gt; Geoprocessing Tools -&gt; Intersection.\nSelect the input layer as the buffered layer, and the overlay layer as the temporary layer.\nSet invalid feature filtering to “Do not Filter”.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.4\n\n\n\nClick “Run” to obtain the region consisting of Lim Chu Kang and Murai areas, but this time without including the restricted nature reserve areas.\nSave this layer as “Lim Chu Kang + Murai” in GeoPackage format.\n\nThe main area in question is Lim Chu Kang. Hence, we want to further concentrate on the Lim Chu Kang region. To do this:\n\nOpen the attribute table of the temporary Lim Chu Kang + Murai Layer, and select the subzone where its name is Lim Chu Kang. That is, key in the expression: “SUBZONE_N” = ‘LIM CHU KANG’ and save it as “Lim Chu Kang Temp”\nNavigate to Vector -&gt; Geoprocessing Tools -&gt; Intersection.\nSelect the input layer as the “Lim Chu Kang + Murai” layer, and the overlay layer as “Lim Chu Kang Temp”.\nSimilarly apply “Do not Filter” to invalid feature filtering.\nClick “Run” to obtain the relevant region.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.5\n\n\nIt would be a waste not to consider the already existing agrivoltaics initiatives and the surrounding reservoirs near Lim Chu Kang. Hence, we will add it to the target regions as well.\n\nOpen the attribute table of “Lim Chu Kang + Murai” layer.\nSelect “Fields and Values”, “LU_DESC”, and click on “All Unique”.\nNotice that there are 4 different types of land use within these regions: AGRICULTURE (agrivoltaics), WATERBODY (reservoirs), OPEN, and PARK.\nEnter this expression: “LU_DESC” = ‘AGRICULTURE’\nClick “Select Features”, then click “Close”.\nRight click on the layer, and Save Selected Features as “Lim Chu Kang + Murai - Agrivoltaics”.\nRepeat the above 3 steps with the expression “LU_DESC” = ‘WATERBODY’ and the layer name “Lim Chu Kang + Murai - Waterbodies’.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.6\n\n\nHowever, not every water body is a reservoir. For this, we consulted Google Maps to determine which ones are reservoirs. Afterwards, we manually select these regions, as there are not too many of them.\n\nAt the top navigation, toggle Select Features by Single Click, as shown in the picture below.\nManually select the areas that denote reservoirs according to Google Maps.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.7\n\n\n\nSave these selected features as “Lim Chu Kang + Murai - Reservoirs”\n\nWe are finally ready to merge everything together.\n\nNavigate to Vector -&gt; Data Management Tools -&gt; Merge Vector Layers Select THREE inputs:\nThe temporary Intersection layer of Lim Chu Kang\nLim Chu Kang + Murai - Agrivoltaics\nLim Chu Kang + Murai - Reservoirs\nClick “Run”, and verify that the output looks something like below.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.8\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.8\n\n\n\nSave this final layer as “Lim Chu Kang + Murai - Target”.\n\nOptionally, we can categorize the target area by land use.\n\nRight click on “Lim Chu Kang + Murai - Target”, and access Properties -&gt; Symbology.\nFrom the top-most dropdown box, select “Categorized”, and the Value to “LU_DESC”.\nClick “Classify”, then click “Ok”.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.10\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.11\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2.12"
